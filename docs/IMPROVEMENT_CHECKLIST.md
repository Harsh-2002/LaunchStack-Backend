# LaunchStack Backend Improvement Checklist

This document tracks the improvements, fixes, and pending tasks for the LaunchStack Backend system.

## ✅ Completed and Tested

1. **Environment Variables & Configuration**
   - ✅ Removed hardcoded secrets from codebase
   - ✅ Implemented secure JWT token generation
   - ✅ Updated domain and endpoint URLs
   - ✅ Removed unnecessary environment variables
   - ✅ Improved CORS configuration (allowing all origins)

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - ✅ Removed hardcoded AdGuard DNS credentials
   - ✅ Removed hardcoded webhook secrets
   - ✅ Implemented proper environment variable validation
   - ✅ Fixed webhook secret validation logic

3. **Docker Integration**
   - ✅ Switched from host bind mounts to Docker volumes
   - ✅ Removed dependency on host filesystem paths
   - ✅ Updated container creation logic
   - ✅ Improved Docker API communication (no more CLI commands)
   - ✅ Enhanced watchtower configuration for auto-updates

4. **Resource Monitoring**
   - ✅ Fixed CPU usage to report as percentage (0-100%)
   - ✅ Removed disk usage monitoring as requested
   - ✅ Increased monitoring frequency to 10 seconds
   - ✅ Implemented parallel stats collection for better performance
   - ✅ Updated API documentation to reflect changes

5. **Code Organization**
   - ✅ Updated and fixed error handling throughout the codebase
   - ✅ Removed unused functions and imports
   - ✅ Added proper context timeout for resource monitoring
   - ✅ Successfully built and tested all changes

## 🔍 Things to Test in Production

1. **Resource Monitoring Accuracy**
   - 🔍 Verify CPU percentage values match actual usage
   - 🔍 Test memory usage reporting under various loads
   - 🔍 Confirm 10-second polling interval doesn't cause performance issues

2. **Docker Volume Management**
   - 🔍 Verify data persistence when containers restart
   - 🔍 Check container cleanup properly removes associated volumes
   - 🔍 Test instance creation with new volume setup

3. **Security Configuration**
   - 🔍 Verify all endpoints work with the new JWT token
   - 🔍 Test webhook endpoints with real payloads
   - 🔍 Confirm CORS settings allow frontend access

## 📝 Pending Tasks

1. **Frontend Updates**
   - 📝 Update resource usage displays to show CPU as percentage
   - 📝 Remove storage usage UI elements
   - 📝 Adjust polling frequency to match 10-second interval
   - 📝 Update resource cards and charts

2. **Documentation**
   - 📝 Update frontend developer documentation
   - 📝 Create operational guides for the new configuration
   - 📝 Document the new resource monitoring approach

3. **Further Optimizations**
   - 📝 Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time monitoring
   - 📝 Add data aggregation for historical resource usage
   - 📝 Optimize database storage for resource usage metrics

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated backend to staging environment
2. Complete frontend updates to match backend changes
3. Conduct end-to-end testing with real instances
4. Deploy to production environment
5. Monitor system performance and resource usage

## Recent Changes Summary

### June 2025 Updates
- Implemented Docker volumes for improved data persistence
- Fixed CPU usage monitoring to report percentage values
- Removed disk usage tracking to simplify monitoring
- Increased resource monitoring frequency to 10 seconds
- Enhanced security by removing all hardcoded credentials
- Updated API documentation to reflect these changes

### Key Technical Improvements
- All Docker operations now use the Docker API instead of CLI commands
- JWT tokens are now generated with proper entropy
- Resource monitoring uses parallel collection for better performance
- Environment configuration has been streamlined
- CORS settings optimized for simpler frontend integration
